While working on something completely unrelated, my colleague Alexandria and I started talking about the NCAA men's basketball tournament. We jokingly threw out the idea of having a series of classes where library resources that filled similar needs competed against each other to see what was better when and for who. We then decided to not just joke about it, and make it happen.

We decided to pilot this year with four matchups (this is pasted from the [blog post](https://library.medicine.yale.edu/blog/medical-library/its-march-madness-cushingwhitney-medical-library) on the library's website):

*Research Impact* 

**Scopus vs Web of Science**

Wednesday, March 21st at 1:00PM
Both Scopus and Web of Science offer access to huge amounts of literature, track citations, offer insights into research impact, and cover multiple disciplines. Which tool reigns supreme? Which one does what better?

*Literature Searching* 

**Ovid Medline vs PubMed**

Wednesday, March 21st at 4:00 PM
Ovid MEDLINE and PubMed both search the MEDLINE journals - but which interface is better? Which database best suits your needs? Ovid’s search building feature and clean interface make it a strong candidate, but strong enough to beat out PubMed’s legacy and features like automatic term mapping? Join Alexandria Brackett for this showdown and decide for yourself!

*Point of Care Bedlam* 

**UpToDate vs DynaMed Plus** 

Thursday, March 22nd at 11:30 AM
During this game (class), we will compare the differences between these two point of care tools. We will assess the validity of the information, the currency of their resources, and the different perks of the two products, including calculators, guidelines, patient education information, and more. Come to this class to help you decide which tool is best for you and your patient care. Refereed by Alexandria Brackett. 

*Citation Management* 

**EndNote vs Zotero**

Both EndNote and Zotero help you manage your references and PDFs, make the creation of bibliographies a breeze, and integrate into paper-writing software such as Microsoft Word for easy citing while you're writing. Both are free. Which is right for you? Which does what better? Come decide for yourself with a showdown refereed by Caitlin Meyer. 

We ended up marketing the series pretty broadly:
- 11x17" flyers all around the School of Medicine
- 8.5x11" flyers for bulliten board calendars around the building
- Facebook cover image and post
- Rotating banner on the library homepage
- Blog post on the library website

An ill-timed snow storm ended up postponing two of our classes, but we plan on doing it again next year and working some of these classes into regular rotation.

Get in the game!
