header: Usability testing for a new A-Z resources list

My colleague recently Andy took on an ambitious web project -- redesigning our A-Z Database List into something more user-friendly. The list was an alphabetical list of 'databases' (but also included some tools and other non-database resources) where users had to click the name to learn more about it, then click again to actually go to the resource. There were many internal debates about what use the page served, who was using it, and what belongs on it. I volunteered to help with various parts of the project (stakeholder interviews, analytics analysis, personas & scenarios, user testing) and it turned out to be a really enjoyable experience.

Prior to this project, I haven't had many opportunities to use the skills I developed in the UX class I took in grad school. It was fun to get back into that mindset and Andy let me take the wheel on writing the user testing packets (procedures, scripts, questions). 

[You can see the packet here](https://caitlinmeyer.github.io/library-blog/docs/usability-packet.pdf), and the finished version of the A-Z List [here](https://library.medicine.yale.edu/find/title).
