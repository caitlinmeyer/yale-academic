Yale recently started an online Physician Assistant program (not to be confused with their longstanding on-the-ground Physicain *Associate* program). We've been trying to figure out how to best reach these students, since we will rarely, if ever, have the opportunity to speak with them in person. 

I was asked to put together a LibGuide for the Online PA program that would be prominently featured in the program's LMS, 2U. When assembling a readings tab, I was delighted to find that the vast majority of their required texts were available as e-books from the library. I had a hunch that this tab was going to be a hit for the students - all their reading in one place without the trouble of toggling between e-books platforms - so I had high hopes for usage for the rest of the guide. 

My colleagues Andy and Alexandria had recently shown me RSS feeds and LibGuides, and so I thought a cool way to produce resource guide content that would be consistently useful to the students but not too labor intensive would be to add RSS feeds from the two prominent PA professional journals on the home page of the guide. Formation of professional identity is a big topic of conversation with regards to online programs - hopefully, with easy access to the latest literature from the field, about the field, this process will be a little easier. 

Here's what it looks like,
