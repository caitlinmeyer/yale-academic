<p>Last week I was invited to speak at the monthly gathering put on by library IT to discuss tech projects and tools that people around the library system are using. The host had seen me present at a different meeting using reveal.js and she was curious about the framework and the potential applications at Yale. Though a brief talk, I was able to sing the praises of reveal.js as an instructional module format as well as its potential for other types of projects. The audience seemed receptive and chuckled as I mentioned I had altered a CSS theme to make it university branding compliant. <BR><BR>Here are the slides from both talks:
