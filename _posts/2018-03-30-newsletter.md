One of my responsibilities on the marketing committee is to work with my colleagues Katie and Melissa to assemble a quarterly newsletter. It's a fun process, trying to pick six stories that really cover the broad scope of the work being done here. It's a little less fun using the Yale Messages system to build out the email - particularly the super finicky 'image map' drawing process to make the photos into hyperlinks. It's worth it, though, because the messages is sent to 14,000 people. I've been lucky the last two quarters to slide in a story about our new classes, and both times we've seen a bump in registrations when the newsletter goes out.

This time around, we focused on a couple events the medical historical library was hosting, the aforementioned classes promo, a shout out to interlibrary loan, and more! [You can see it in browser here.](http://yppsweb1.its.yale.edu/emailuploads/pages/km5533292018113801.html)
