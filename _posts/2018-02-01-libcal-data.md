header: Optimizing library workshop scheduling with LibCal data

Coordinating the library general instruction program is a big part of my job. This means teaching classes, yes, but it also means thinking about bigger-picture things like - Is there any rhyme or reason to when we hold classes? When should we be holding classes? 

Digging into LibCal data, I found that we had started to require registration for classes in September 2016. It was November 2017 at the time, so I had a solid data set of more than a year. Since we weren't tracking actual attendance (you bet the program is now!!), registrations is the closest we could get. 

The findings regarding time of day were interesting: 

- 11:00 is our most frequent timeslot for classes
- Of timeslots that had at least 10 classes, 13:00 had the highest registration count
- Classes at 16:00 draw well, supporting our anecdotal “beginning and end of day are best” theory
- Average registrations in the 9:00-9:30 range do not resoundingly support the first half of the “beginning and end of day are best” theory
- Our inclination to have a lot of 10:00 classes seems to be supported by data
- 12:00, despite logic that people have a free lunch break, doesn’t draw that well

Which lead to the action items: 

- Schedule more classes at 13:00, 10:00, and 16:00
- Stay away from 12:00 unless we permit food (e.g. brown bag sessions), and see if that works

The findings from looking at the day of the week: 

- By far, we offer the most classes on Thursdays - Fridays perform surprisingly well
- Everybody has a case of the Mondays

Action items:
- Encourage more Friday classes
- Explore why we have so many on Thursdays and if that is the best we can be offering to our patrons

Going forward, with emphasis on the action items, I'm excited to see if this works to boost attendance.
