header: Driving traffic to underutilized resources with Resource Spotlight
---

Despite the wealth of resources Yale provides access to, usage is often concentrated in databases and tools that our users had access to at their previous institutions. In other words, changing behavior is difficult. In an effort to promote underutilized or expensive (or both!) resources, I proposed launching a *Resource Spotlight* monthly blog post series. Each post is accompanied by cool graphics made by our design intern Rosa and various staff nominate resources in their domain to highlight. So far, the Google Analytics data reveals the average user is spending approximately 90 seconds on each post and more than half go onto access the featured resource. Over time, I hope to track usage statistics and see if there's any correlation between the publication of *Resource Spotlight* and increased, sustained utilization of the tool.
