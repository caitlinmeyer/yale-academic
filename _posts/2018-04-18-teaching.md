Teaching is a big part of my job. Not only do I coordinate the general library instruction program (thinking about things like scheduling, marketing, etc.), but I also develop and deliver classes. I'm lucky to work in such a collaborative environment and have been able to do a lot of co-teaching as well. 

I think that the best kind of library workshop is the kind where attendees leave thinking that a) this has been a good use of their time, b) the class taught them how to save time or do better research going forward, and, most importantly, c) the library's got their back. 

Since we post the classes on the School of Medicine calendar, a lot of people's first interactions with the library are through these workshops. I'm hoping with how frequently we're teaching now and the work we've put in to standardizing learning objectives across our offerings that these are positive experiences and the beginning of sustained relationships with the library. 

Here's what I've been teaching since I started: EndNote, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Zotero, and workshops focusing on general literature searches. You'll see soon on my MLA poster, but I've been looking into what other libraries in our tier of medical schools are teaching -- and it's looking like professional development is an area many of our peers are venturing into. This is something I'm definitely interested in pursuing, since I somehow think personal branding is fun (think LinkedIn, poster design, personal websites, etc.). 

If you want to see what we're up to, here is the [class calendar](https://library.medicine.yale.edu/classes).
