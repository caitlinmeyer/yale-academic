A unique feature of the Yale Physician Associate (yes, Associate, not Assistant) program is that the students are required to complete a research-intensive thesis project. The library is, of course, excited to be involved in this undertaking and we get to work really closely with the students over the course of their time here. In the past, we've met with each student (~40 per year) for an hour in December to discuss search strategies, databases to use, citation management, and starting literature reviews. This year, my colleagues were wondering if this labor-intensive method was really the best way to go about things.<BR><BR>
After speaking with the professor, it was decided we'd have six two-hour sessions in lieu of the ~40 hours of individual meetings. How would we structure these sessions, though? How would individuals get as much out of a group workshop as they get out of one-on-one meetings?<BR><BR>
I came up with the idea of a self-assessment that students would take, reflecting critically on their skills in four key areas (developing a research question, creating a search strategy, utilizing EndNote, and synthesizing articles). We could then base each session on the survey responses of the students in the room, mirroring the individualization of the one-on-ones with the added bonus of productive groupwork and saved librarian time. <BR>

I built the survey in Qualtrics, colleagues from throughout the library tested and critiqued it, and we deployed it a few weeks later. Using Qualtrics' piped text function, it was possible to have the last page of the survey provide the students with a tally of all of the skills they feel confident in. Seeing, "You feel confident in 7 of 17 core skills needed to successfully complete your project." may have struck some fear into their hearts, but it also underscored the value of the library in getting where they need to be. The results page also displayed all the competencies the students felt they were a 'Maybe' or a 'No' in.<BR>
