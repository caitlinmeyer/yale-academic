Though the summer and fall are orientation high season at the medical library with the arrival of new residents and students, there are always new researchers and post-docs arriving. My colleague Rolando recognized the need to reach this population of late arrivals, to share with them the vast array of free resources and services available to them while they are at Yale. Once he looped a few more of us in, we realized that an open monthly orientation was a better approach than specifically marketing to post-docs. In two effective meetings, we developed an outline of crucial content for all audiences and then I made the slidedeck. The four of us will be taking turns teaching this 20-minute session, so the overall time commitment to value added to the community ratio was great.
