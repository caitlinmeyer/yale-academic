<p>Yale started its bioinformatics support program in 2014 with the hiring of my colleague Rolando Garcia-Milian. In that time, he's built a robust suite of resources and services for Yale affiliates that only continues to grow in popularity. <BR><BR>However, with that popularity has come a number of misconceptions and misunderstandings about where our services fit into the research cycle -- this video aims to specifically illustrate where our services fit in. This project also unexpectedly gave us non-experts a way to talk about Rolo's work and a tool to refer potential collaborators to for more information.<br><BR>
  


To create this video, I used Hype3, Camtasia, and Audacity. I also created vectorized versions of the database logos in Adobe Illustrator.<BR><BR>
  
 The project was featured in our fall <a href="http://yppsweb1.its.yale.edu/emailuploads/pages/km55310242017111208.html">newsletter</a>, which reaches nearly 14,000 people, as well as on the library's <a href="https://library.medicine.yale.edu/blog/bioinformatics/new-video-bioinformatics-yale">blog</a>.</p><BR><BR>
