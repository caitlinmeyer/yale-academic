That headline is likely incomprehensible to most people, so let me break it down: WI+RE, the team I was so lucky to be on as a graduate student at UCLA, won an award from the Association of Research Libraries (ARL)'s film festival! The project, "Getting Started with Research at UCLA", interviewed five students from across disciplines to talk about how they got into undergraduate research and how it's benefitted them in their academic and personal lives. Taylor, Shannon, and Mary did the heavy lifting on this project, but I did help with the video editing, sound editing, and script writing. It won "Best Reflection of Diversity", which is really makes me proud. Research has its stereotypes and silos, and if this video convinces one student outside of those groups to give it a go, we've accomplished something.
