On Saturday, I'll be heading to my first MLA (Medical Library Association) conference. It'll be five days in Atlanta of presentations, posters, and parties -- and a whole lot of networking. Looking through the conference program, there are almost too many presentations that I want to go to. The instructional design thread seems particularly useful. I'm hoping in my time at MLA to learn about how to better market and assess our educational programming. Learning more about online library classes will be useful as well, as transforming all of our workshops into online ones (to be accessible for our distance program and remote users) is a key goal for the next fiscal year.

I'm presenting a poster on Tuesday about the work I've done so far on our education program -- it highlights some background research, standardizing workshops, survey-driven workshops, and more. Check it out!
