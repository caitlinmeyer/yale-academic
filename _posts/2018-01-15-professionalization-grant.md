I'm excited to share that my colleague Alexandria Brackett and I have received provisional acceptance of our grant proposal, *Investigating research and clinical education services in regional health science libraries*. SCOPA, the Standing Committee on Professional Awareness, at the Yale Unviersity Library offers librarians grant funding to pursue professionalization projects. Ours incldues visiting regional medical libraries to see how they deliver instruction to their users (both online and in-person) as well as get a sense of the services offered to their clinical populations. We have a year to complete the project, and here is [the proposal](https://caitlinmeyer.github.io/library-blog/docs/scopa.pdf).
