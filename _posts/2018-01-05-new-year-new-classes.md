In the fall, I convened a group of colleagues to discuss the way we were teaching PubMed and EndNote. At that time, six librarians were teaching both topics and students were leaving classes with completely different experiences. The culture here is very autonomous, so something as prescriptive as scripts, slides, or outlines would likely not go over well. I thought, and still think, though, that if we're going to call a class taught by different people the same thing (e.g. Hands-on PubMed), then there should at least be universal learning objectives. So that's the level of sameness that was declared agreeable by the group and on we went. Copied from the [library website blog post](https://library.medicine.yale.edu/blog/medical-library/new-year-new-classes-check-out-our-new-pubmed-and-endnote-workshops-0) about the project, here's what we ended up with: 

**PubMed**

We realize that our different user groups use the same products in very different ways. Residents and attending physicians may need quick answers to clinical questions whereas students writing their theses may need a more comprehensive search of the literature. We also realize everybody is very busy and 60 minutes are hard to find. To meet these needs, we’ve created two new 30 minute PubMed classes: PubMed for Clinicians and PubMed for Research. Both classes are followed by an optional half-hour hands-on session where attendees can work through their own questions or provided examples. 

**EndNote**

Despite offering the same functionality, EndNote looks very different on Apple computers and PCs. To address these discrepancies and make learning basic EndNote tasks easier, we’ve split the introductory class into two: EndNote for Mac and EndNote for PC. Attendees can bring their own computers to become familiar with the interface and create a functioning, organized library by the end of the class. For advanced users, we’ve created a retooled Advanced EndNote class where attendees will fill out a survey prior to the class that lets the instructors cater each session to the needs and questions of the people in the room. No two sessions will be alike!

We will be tracking attendance for these new iterations of the classes and re-group as an ad-hoc committee in April to discuss how it's going so far.
