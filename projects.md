## Selected Projects
## Yale, 2017 - present
### Framing Questions with PICO
One of the key concepts we teach is the searching framework PICO. We decided that a video explaining it would be useful as a standalone tutorial, a review for students we've seen in the past, and homework to watch prior to future workshops. To create this video, I used Hype3, Camtasia, and Audacity.

### Instructional Media Toolkit
This one's kind of meta. I serve on the Research, Outreach & Instruction committee and was asked to put together a toolkit for producing online learning objects. So what better way to do so than a static webpage hosted by Github? I wanted to share with colleagues tools, examples, and other information they'll need to jump into this arena. [View the toolkit here.](https://caitlinmeyer.github.io/instructional-media/)

### Bioinformatics at Yale 
Yale started its bioinformatics support program in 2014 with the hiring of my colleague Rolando Garcia-Milian. In that time, he's built a robust suite of resources and services for Yale affiliates that only continues to grow in popularity. To create this video, I used Hype3, Camtasia, and Audacity. I also created vectorized versions of the database logos in Adobe Illustrator.

## UCLA, 2016 - 2017

The following work was made as part of the WI+RE (Writing Instruction & Research Education) group - a grant-funded, cross campus collaborative team housed in the UCLA Louise M. Darling Biomedical Library that makes multimedia online learning modules to help undergraduates further develop crucial writing and research skills. Check out the team's [website](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/). It was a foundational and super fun experience. Our toolkit included Adobe Suite, Audacity, Camtasia, Hype3, and Videoscribe for media production and Box, Github, Google Docs, and Trello for project management. I worked in every stage of module production (learning objectives, scripting, recording, producing visuals), as well as conducting user testing, learning management system implementation, and promotion.

### Introduction to Zotero

This project utilized videos, gifs, and the reveal.js framework to create a robust introduction to the citation management software Zotero. My part of this project included determining the information architecture of the slideshow, screencasting for one of the videos, writing copy, creating gifs, and modifying HTML to produce the slides. I got to make a [poster](https://caitlinmeyer.github.io/docs/2017-code4lib.pdf) and [present](http://2017.code4lib.org/posters/Reimagining-the-slideshow-using-revealjs-to-create-Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-library-tutorials) at the 2017 Code4Lib conference on this project.

### Creating a Literature Review 

This video was intended to be the introduction to the entire literature review instructional sequence, illustrating to students the usefulness of the genre of writing for a variety of disciplines and situations.
I wrote the script, created the visuals in Hype3, and edited together the final product.

### Navigating the Undergraduate Research Portal - For Faculty

This was a quick project done for the Undergraduate Research Centers at UCLA, who wanted to teach faculty and students how to use their new undergraduate research portal. There are two versions - one for students, one for faculty. You'll find the faculty version below. I wrote the initial script, did the screencasting in Camtasia, and assembled the final product.
