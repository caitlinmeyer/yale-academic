## Selected Projects


## UCLA, 2016 - 2017
### Introduction to Zotero

This project utilized videos, gifs, and the reveal.js framework to create a robust introduction to the citation management software Zotero. My part of this project included determining the information architecture of the slideshow, screencasting for one of the videos, writing copy, creating gifs, and modifying HTML to produce the slides. I got to make a [poster](https://caitlinmeyer.github.io/docs/2017-code4lib.pdf) and [present](http://2017.code4lib.org/posters/Reimagining-the-slideshow-using-revealjs-to-create-Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-library-tutorials) at the 2017 Code4Lib conference on this project.

### Navigating the Undergraduate Research Portal - For Faculty

This was a quick project done for the Undergraduate Research Centers at UCLA, who wanted to teach faculty and students how to use their new undergraduate research portal. There are two versions - one for students, one for faculty. You'll find the faculty version below. I wrote the initial script, did the screencasting in Camtasia, and assembled the final product.
